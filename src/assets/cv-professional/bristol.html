            I briefly trained to be a secondary school Mathematics teacher, 
            beginning a PGCE at Bristol University, due to my existing 
            interest in mathematics education and outreach.

            I mostly enjoyed teaching A-level, and probably spent too much time
            on coding projects (for educational purposes!) rather than the day-to-day 
            teaching. I eventually decided to pursue a Ph.D. when the opportunity arose.
