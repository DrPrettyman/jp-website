        I was fortunate to have the time and opportunity, during my Ph.D. research, to take on a summer internship at the Met Office Informatics Lab.
        I chose to take on a project that sought to quantify the viability of using amateur weather station data to improve the accuracy of the Met Office's weather forecasts.

        The Met Office relies on a network of professional weather stations to provide data for their weather models, complementing this with data from satellites and other sources.
        But there are hundreds of dedicated amateur meteorologists who have their own weather stations â€” some simple, some very sophisticated. 
        The Met Office has a portal for these enthusiasts to upload their data but does not currently use it in their models.

        After writing some scripts to access the amateur and official observations (the Informatics Lab was unable to obtain 
        direct access for me in time, so I had to use the external APIs). I proceeded in two directions:

    <ul>
        <li>Assessing the reliability and coverage of the amateur data.</li>
        <li>Comparing the amateur observations to official (but interpolated) observations from the same time.</li>
    </ul>

        I was, unfortunately, unable to complete the project in the time available, 
        but I was able to identify a number of issues with the amateur data and 
        show that it is not yet ready for use in the Met Office's weather models.
