            My Ph.D. research focussed on detecting (or rather, predicting) 
            tipping points in dynamical systems using time series data. I was 
            funded by <a href="https://www.epsrc.ac.uk">EPSRC</a> and was 
            able to publish three papers in respected journals and to 
            present my work at a number of international conferences and workshops.

            I built on the work of Dr. Valerie Livina to develop a novel method: 
            the use of the <em>power spectrum scaling exponent</em> as an indicator 
            of critical slowing down, which I showed to be related to the existing ACF(1) and DFA 
            indicators. I also applied the method to a range of geophysical datasets, 
            notably changes in sea-level pressure as a precursor to tropical cyclones.

            I created stochastic models of dynamical systems and implemented 
            Early Warning Signal algorithms using Matlab and Python. I also 
            used Python to process and analyse geophysical datasets, and to
            access data from external APIs.
