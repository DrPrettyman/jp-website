            During my Undergraduate MA at the University of Edinburgh, I focused on 
            pure mathematics, with modules including:
            <em>Groups and Rings</em>, <em>Algebraic Number Theory</em>, <em>Algebraic Geometry</em> 
            and <em>Algebraic Topology</em>. My dissertation project explored the 
            properties of directed graphs and their relation to non-commutative algebras.
            The software I wrote for this project (<a href="/projects/digraph-explorer">Digraph Explorer</a>) was used as a teaching resource, for which 
            I received a letter of thanks from the Principal.

            Throughout my degree I was dedicated to Maths Outreach and volunteered at 
            public events and at local schools. I even gave my own series of seminars 
            on probability to "gifted and talented" school students. I was also a 
            member of Edinburgh Maths Jam and took modules in Maths Education in my 
            final year.
