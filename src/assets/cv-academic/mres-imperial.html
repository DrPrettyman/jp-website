            This Masters course involved applied mathematics taught course including: 
            <em>Probability</em>, <em>Statistics</em>, <em>Stochastic PDEs</em>, <em>Dynamical Systems</em> and <em>Scientific Computing With Python</em>.

            As part of the <a href="https://mpecdt.ac.uk/cohort-2014/">Mathematics of Planet Earth CDT</a> 
            I attended weekly workshops and seminars led by experts in the field, as well as taking part in 
            weekly group meetings to discuss the latest research in the field, and weekly soft-skills sessions.

            In the second half of the course I was supervised by Dr. Hilary Weller 
            for a dissertation project which developed a method for generating an adaptive mesh 
            for PDE solvers. This numerical method was built on Dr. Weller's previous work and 
            implemented in C++.
