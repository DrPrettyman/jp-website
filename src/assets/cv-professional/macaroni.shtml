        I created Macaroni as internal software for the Blink SEO team, which was successful in increasing productivity by over 20&times;.
        The management team decided to market it as a SaaS product. 
        We streamlined the product and positioned it as a Shopify platform, allowing us to focus on the most common use-case and 
        provide a more tailored solution for our clients.

        Macaroni is a data engineering and machine learning platform that automates data ingestion, cleaning, analysis, and provides actionable insights for SEO teams.
        As a new startup Macaroni hired a data engineer, front-end developer, and a product manager to take the product to market. 
        I worked with the new team to onboard them and hand over parts of the project, freeing up time to work on the machine learning features, 
        and still consulting regularly with the Blink SEO delivery team to understand their processes and requirements.

        <li>Agile development alongside new team members for continual integration and deployment.</li>
        
        <li>I refined the use of LLMs to generate page content, in consultation with Blink SEO's resident copywriter.</li>
        
        <li>I replaced part of the web-scraping process with data pulled directly from the Shopify GraphQL API to provide 
            better data quality and reduce the load on the servers. This also allowed for more frequent updates and 
            insights based on real-time product catalogue data.</li>
