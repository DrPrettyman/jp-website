            At Sheffield Hallam University I taught a variety of Mathematics and Computer Science courses, dealing with 
            planning, marking and delivering lectures.
            I also took on the role of "Maths Help" person, providing support to any struggling students by appointment or during drop-in sessions. 
            This was interesting as I got to meet engineering students who were confused by 
            Laplace transforms, business students who were struggling with basic algebra, and sports science students who needed help with statistics.
