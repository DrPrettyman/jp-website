        I was lucky enough to collaborate with Dr Valerie Livina at NPL during my doctoral research. 
        This was an interesting opportunity to apply my mathematical and statistical knowledge in the research area of tipping points, 
        with applications to geophysical systems. During my time at NPL I developed a new method for detecting tipping points in time series data, 
        published three papers in respected journals, and presented at several international conferences.

        My research was focused on the detection of tipping points in time series data, which are points at which the system undergoes a rapid change in behaviour.
        I developed the Power Spectrum Indicator method to provide early warning signals of tipping points, building on
        Dr Livina's previous work on the DFA Exponent indicator.
